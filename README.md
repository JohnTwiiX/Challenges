# Juice Shop Challenges

## Introduction

OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally vulnerable web application developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) for educational purposes. It is designed to simulate a real-world e-commerce site and provides a comprehensive platform for testing and learning about web security vulnerabilities. Juice Shop is a perfect platform for security professionals, developers, and students to practice and understand various web security issues, allowing them to identify, exploit, and learn how to fix these vulnerabilities.

### Key Features

- **Wide Range of Challenges**: Juice Shop includes a variety of security challenges ranging from beginner to expert levels.
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Each challenge is based on real-world vulnerabilities, making it a valuable learning tool.
- **Gamification**: The application incorporates elements of gamification to make learning fun and engaging.
- **Community Support**: Being an OWASP project, Juice Shop has strong community support and regular updates.

## Vulnerabilities and Dangers

### Improper Input Validation

**Challenge**: [Admin Registration](./Admin_Registration/README.md)

**Improper Input Validation** occurs when an application fails to properly validate the input data before processing it. This can lead to several security issues, including:

- **SQL Injection**: Attackers can manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Users may inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others.
- **Command Injection**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Dangers**:

- **Data Breaches**: Sensitive information can be exposed or altered.
- **System Compromise**: Entire systems can be taken over by malicious actors.
- **Service Disruption**: Applications may become unresponsive or behave unpredictably.

### Broken Access Control

**Challenge**: [Forged Feedback](./Forged_Feedback/README.md)

**Broken Access Control** refers to vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized users to access restricted areas or data within an application. This can include:

- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: Accessing resources or functions meant for other users.
- **Vertical Privilege Escalation**: Gaining access to administrative or privileged functions.

**Dangers**:

- **Unauthorized Data Access**: Confidential data may be viewed or altered by unauthorized users.
- **Privilege Abuse**: Malicious users may exploit elevated privileges to harm the system or other users.
- **Regulatory Non-compliance**: Violating data protection regulations can lead to legal issues and fines.

### Broken Authentication

**Challenge**: [Reset Bjoern's Password](./Reset_Bjoerns_Password/README.md)

**Broken Authentication** involves flaws in the authentication mechanism that attackers can exploit to impersonate other users. Common issues include:

- **Credential Stuffing**: Using lists of breached credentials to gain unauthorized access.
- **Session Hijacking**: Stealing or manipulating session tokens to impersonate users.
- **Weak Password Policies**: Allowing users to set easily guessable passwords.

**Dangers**:

- **Identity Theft**: Attackers can assume the identity of legitimate users.
- **Data Manipulation**: Unauthorized actions can be performed on behalf of legitimate users.
- **Account Takeover**: Complete control over user accounts can be gained by attackers.

## Getting Started with Juice Shop

1. **Installation**: You can run Juice Shop locally using Docker or Node.js.
2. **Explore Challenges**: Navigate through different levels of challenges designed to expose and exploit various vulnerabilities.
3. **Learning Resources**: Utilize OWASP's documentation and community forums for guidance and learning.

## Conclusion

OWASP Juice Shop offers an excellent opportunity to learn and practice web security. Understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities like Improper Input Validation, Broken Access Control, and Broken Authentication are crucial in developing secure applications. By tackling Juice Shop challenges, you will enhance your skills and knowledge in protecting real-world applications from these common yet dangerous vulnerabilities.
